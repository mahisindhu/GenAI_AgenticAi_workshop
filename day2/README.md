# Day 2 – Prompt Engineering Techniques (Generative AI Workshop)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the Day 2 Jupyter/Colab notebook from a Generative AI workshop,
focusing on prompt engineering methodologies used to control, optimize, and evaluate
the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). The notebook emphasizes practical
implementation and design patterns used in real-world GenAI systems.

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Covered
- Instruction Prompting for task specification and output control
- Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot Prompting for pattern learning and response consistency
- Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting for multi-step reasoning and logical decomposition
- Template Prompting for reusable, structured prompt design
- Context Window and Token Constraints in LLM inference
- Limitations of prompt-only approaches
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a solution for dynamic context injection

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing this notebook, the learner will be able to:
- Design structured prompts to guide LLM behavior effectively
- Select appropriate prompting strategies based on task complexity
- Improve reasoning accuracy using Chain of Thought prompting
- Build reusable prompt templates for scalable applications
- Understand LLM limitations related to context length and token usage
- Explain why RAG is required to overcome static prompt constraints

## 🧪 Implementation Highlights
- Prompt design experiments using a Generative AI model
- Comparative analysis of different prompting techniques
- Practical examples demonstrating response variation based on prompt structure
- Clear linkage between prompt engineering and downstream GenAI pipelines

## 📘 Day-2 Technical Learning Summary
On Day 2, I explored prompt engineering as a control layer for LLMs. I implemented
instruction-based prompts and compared zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot approaches
to evaluate response consistency and accuracy. I applied Chain of Thought prompting
to improve performance on reasoning-intensive tasks. I also analyzed template
prompting, identifying its limitations due to context window and token constraints,
and studied how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by
dynamically retrieving and injecting relevant external context into the prompt.

## 📝 Notes
This repository is intended for educational and experimental purposes as part of a
structured Generative AI training program.
