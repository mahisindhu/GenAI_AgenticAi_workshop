# 🚀 Day 2 – Prompt Engineering Techniques (Generative AI Workshop)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the Day 2 Colab notebook from a Generative AI workshop.
The focus of this session is on understanding and implementing prompt engineering
techniques used to control, optimize, and evaluate the behavior of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in real-world GenAI applications.

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Covered
- Instruction Prompting
- Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot Prompting
- Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting
- Template Prompting
- Context Window and Token Limitations
- Limitations of Prompt-only Approaches
- Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this notebook, the learner will be able to:
- Design clear and structured prompts for LLMs
- Select appropriate prompting strategies based on task complexity
- Improve reasoning accuracy using Chain of Thought prompting
- Create reusable prompt templates for scalable applications
- Understand token usage and context window constraints
- Explain how RAG overcomes the limitations of static prompting

## 🧪 Notebook Highlights
- Hands-on implementation of multiple prompting techniques
- Comparative analysis of different prompt strategies
- Practical code examples using a Generative AI model
- Clear connection between prompt design and real-world GenAI systems

## 📘 Day-2 Learning Summary
On Day 2, I learned how prompt engineering acts as a control layer for Large
Language Models. I explored instruction prompting and compared zero-shot,
one-shot, and few-shot techniques to understand response consistency and accuracy.
I applied Chain of Thought prompting for reasoning-intensive tasks and studied
template prompting along with its limitations related to token size and context
window. I also understood how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps overcome
these limitations by dynamically injecting relevant external context into prompts.
