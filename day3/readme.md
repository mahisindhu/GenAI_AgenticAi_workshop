# Day 3 – APIs, Endpoints & Environment Setup (Generative AI Workshop)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the Day 3 Jupyter/Colab notebook from a Generative AI
workshop. The focus of this day is on understanding APIs, endpoints, HTTP methods,
and environment setup, which are essential for building and running a GenAI
chatbot application.

The notebook also connects these concepts to a practical Flask-based chatbot
backend implementation.

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Covered
- API Endpoints and their role in client–server communication
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Request–response flow in web applications
- Virtualization and isolated development environments
- Environment management using Miniconda
- Backend integration using Flask and Google GenAI

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing this notebook, the learner will be able to:
- Understand what an API endpoint is and how it is used
- Differentiate between common HTTP methods and their purposes
- Explain how frontend and backend communicate in a chatbot
- Set up and manage virtual environments using Miniconda
- Run a Flask-based GenAI backend inside an isolated environment

## 🧪 Implementation Highlights
- Creation of Flask endpoints to serve frontend and handle chatbot requests
- Use of POST requests to send user messages to the backend
- Integration of Google GenAI model for response generation
- Execution of the chatbot inside a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts

## 📘 Day-3 Technical Learning Summary
On Day 3, I learned how APIs and endpoints enable communication between the
frontend and backend of a GenAI application. I understood the role of HTTP
methods, especially POST, in sending user messages to the chatbot backend.
I also learned the importance of virtualization and environment management
using Miniconda to isolate dependencies. Finally, I implemented a simple
Flask backend that connects the chatbot UI with a Gemini model to generate
AI-based responses.

## 🚀 Next Steps
This notebook prepares the foundation for:
- Stateful chatbot design
- Advanced backend logic
- RAG-based chatbot pipelines
- Full-stack GenAI application deployment

## 📝 Notes
This repository is intended for educational and experimental purposes as part
of a structured Generative AI training program.
