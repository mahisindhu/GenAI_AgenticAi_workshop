# Day 4 – NLP Basics & Text Preprocessing (Generative AI Workshop)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the Day 4 Jupyter/Colab notebook from a Generative AI
workshop. The focus of this day is on understanding the **basics of Natural
Language Processing (NLP)** and the **text preprocessing techniques** required
before applying machine learning or Generative AI models.

These concepts form the foundation for building chatbots, search systems,
and language-based AI applications.

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Covered
- Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Why NLP is required for language-based AI systems
- Tokenization (sentence and word tokenization)
- Text cleaning using regular expressions (regex)
- Text normalization techniques
- Stemming and types of stemmers
- Lemmatization and WordNet lemmatizer
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Role of POS tags in accurate lemmatization

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing this notebook, the learner will be able to:
- Explain why NLP is required for understanding human language
- Perform basic text preprocessing steps on raw text
- Apply tokenization to split text into meaningful units
- Clean text using regex-based rules
- Normalize text using lowercasing, stemming, and lemmatization
- Differentiate between stemming and lemmatization
- Use POS tagging to improve lemmatization accuracy

## 🧪 Implementation Highlights
- Hands-on text preprocessing using NLTK
- Tokenization using the Punkt tokenizer
- Cleaning text with regular expressions
- Applying Porter, Snowball, and Lancaster stemmers
- Lemmatization using WordNet Lemmatizer
- POS tagging and mapping POS tags to WordNet format
- Demonstrating how POS improves lemmatization results

## 📘 Day-4 Technical Learning Summary
On Day 4, I learned the core concepts of Natural Language Processing and how raw
text is prepared before being used in AI models. I explored tokenization,
text cleaning using regex, and normalization techniques. I understood the
difference between stemming and lemmatization and why lemmatization is more
accurate when POS tags are used. These preprocessing steps are essential for
building effective chatbots and NLP-based GenAI applications.

## 🚀 Next Steps
This notebook builds the foundation for:
- Vectorization and embeddings
- Semantic similarity and retrieval
- RAG-based chatbot pipelines
- Advanced NLP and LLM workflows

## 📝 Notes
This repository is intended for educational and experimental purposes as part
of a structured Generative AI training program.
