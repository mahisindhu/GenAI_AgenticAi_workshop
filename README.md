# Day 5 – NLP Pipeline, Embeddings & Similarity (Generative AI Workshop)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the Day 5 Jupyter/Colab notebook from a Generative AI
workshop. The focus of this day is on understanding the **complete NLP pipeline**
and how text is converted into **numerical representations (embeddings)** for
use in machine learning and Generative AI systems.

These concepts are critical for building search systems, recommendation engines,
and RAG-based chatbots.

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Covered
- End-to-end NLP preprocessing pipeline
- Tokenization, cleaning, and normalization recap
- Text representation techniques
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
- Word and sentence embeddings
- Semantic similarity between texts
- Role of embeddings in modern GenAI systems

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing this notebook, the learner will be able to:
- Understand how raw text flows through an NLP pipeline
- Convert text into numerical features
- Explain BoW and TF-IDF representations
- Understand what embeddings are and why they are powerful
- Measure similarity between text samples
- Explain how embeddings are used in search and RAG systems

## 🧪 Implementation Highlights
- Building a basic NLP preprocessing pipeline
- Generating Bag of Words representations
- Applying TF-IDF for weighted text representation
- Creating embeddings for words or sentences
- Computing similarity between text inputs
- Observing how similar texts have closer vector representations

## 📘 Day-5 Technical Learning Summary
On Day 5, I learned how text is transformed into numerical form using an NLP
pipeline. I explored traditional techniques such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF
and understood their limitations. I then studied embeddings, which capture
semantic meaning and enable similarity-based retrieval. These concepts are
fundamental for modern GenAI applications such as semantic search and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## 🚀 Next Steps
This notebook prepares the foundation for:
- Vector databases (FAISS, Chroma)
- Semantic search systems
- RAG pipeline implementation
- Agent-based GenAI workflows

## 📝 Notes
This repository is intended for educational and experimental purposes as part
of a structured Generative AI training program.
